CompSci 308: SLogo Addition
===

# Before

### Estimation

 * How long do you think it will take you to complete this new feature?
    * I think this feature will take about 10 minutes

 * How many files will you need to add or update? Why?
    * I think I will just have to update one class, the class of the menu that pops up when you click on a turtle, 
    and I will just have to add a turtle command to the list of available commands to run on that turtle.



# After

### Review

 * How long did it take you to complete this new feature?
    * It took me about three minutes to complete this feature.

 * How many files did you need to add or update? Why?
    * I just needed to update one file to add this feature because the turtle context commands for what you can run 
    on a single turtle are all in one place

 * Did you get it completely right on the first try? If not, why not?
    * Yes I did


### Analysis

 * What do you feel this exercise reveals about your project's design and documentation --- was it as good (or bad) as you remembered?
    * This exercise suggest that our project's design was awesome and super extensible, at least in this aresa
 
 * What about the design or documentation could be improved?
    * There could be more high level design documentation. If I was not already familiar with the code it would have 
    taken a while to figure out where the change I needed to make was

 * What would it have been like if you were not familiar with the code at all?
    * It would have been much harder if I wasn't at all familiar with the code. I may have not even known that there 
    was the option to click on an individual turtle and run commands if I wasn't familiar with the code so I may have
     had to start from scratch.
