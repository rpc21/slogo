CompSci 308: SLogo Addition
===

# Before

### Estimation

 * How long do you think it will take you to complete this new feature?
    * I think this feature will take about 10 minutes

 * How many files will you need to add or update? Why?
    * I think I will just have to update one class, the class of the menu that pops up when you click on a turtle, 
    and I will just have to add a turtle command to the list of available commands to run on that turtle.



# After

### Review

 * How long did it take you to complete this new feature?

 * How many files did you need to add or update? Why?

 * Did you get it completely right on the first try? If not, why not?


### Analysis

 * What do you feel this exercise reveals about your project's design and documentation --- was it as good (or bad) as you remembered?

 * What about the design or documentation could be improved?

 * What would it have been like if you were not familiar with the code at all?
